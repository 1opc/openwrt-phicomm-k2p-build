# openwrt-phicomm-k2p-build-config
OpenWrt/LEDE build config for Phicomm K2P Wireless router.

If you want to use this config file to compile your firmware, go to here first to get the source code repository and more config info:

https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede/

Then put the .config file under the code directory and run `make -jX V=s`, X as your CPU core number.

If I keep this file up to date, you should be able to compile your own firmware.

Use it as your own risk.
